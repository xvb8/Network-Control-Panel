## Network Control Panel

This is a frontend for Windows Firewall with Advanced Security that also supports blocking entire folders, which the firewall itself doesn't.
The executable is located under dist. Keep in mind it requires admin privileges since it modifies firewall rules.
The source code and related files can also be found here. The executable is standalone, meaning you can take it out of this folder.
The inbound checkbox allows you to block data coming in from the internet to that folder. The outbound checkbox allows you to block it from sending data over the internet. This is all done via Windows Firewall, and thus will only work for Windows.
To block a folder, click select folder and select the folder. The path should pop up, with two checkboxes and a delete button.
